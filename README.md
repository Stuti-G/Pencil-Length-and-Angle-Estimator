# Pencil-Length-and-Angle-Estimator
This repository contains a computer vision-based solution for analyzing the length, angle, and intersection of two pencils in an image. The program estimates the length of both pencils (assuming 1px = 0.1mm), calculates the angle between them, and highlights the region where the pencils intersect.
